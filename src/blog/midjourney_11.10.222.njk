  While some aspects of artificial intelligence are in a relatively primitive
  stage, massive progress is being made by research labs across the globe. One
  of these labs, "Midjourney" is best-known for its artificial intelligence
  engine used to generate original pieces of art from a Discord server.
  Fortunately, making AI Art is very simple even for non-technical folks. Let's
  learn how to get started so you can make designs in under 45 seconds!

<h2>How To Use Midjourney</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>1. Sign-Up</h3> 
<p> Head to <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/" target="_blank"
    ><strong>Midjourney.com</strong></a >
  and select "Join the Beta." From there you will be redirected to a Discord
  server invitation. Go ahead and accept the invite, then launch Discord! Next, you can enter any of
  the "newbies" chatrooms.
</p>

<h3>2. Writing Commands</h3>
<p>
  Moving on, you can start to create AI Art by typing commands into the chat. Enter
  "/imagine" then hit tab. This is always the starting point for your Midjourney
  commands.
</p>

<p>
Within the "prompt" area, you can let your imagination free. Type in any description for the image you are trying to generate. The general guidance is to include commas between the individual pieces of your command. See below one example:

<h3>3. Processing/Modifying Images</h3>
<p>Once you are content with your Midjourney command, press "enter" to process the image. The engine will likely take less than a minute to create 4 variations. Below the created images, are "U" and "V" options which can be utilized to single out an image for modifications. The "U" options will create an upscale or higher resolution version of the image you select (U1 targeting the top left image).</p>

<p>The "V" options can be used to create Variations of the image you select. This option will create 4 new images that follow a similar style to whichever image you selected.</p>

<p>
If you are not fond of any of the images Midjourney creates, you can click the refresh button to generate 4 new images. Once fully content with the output, you can click on the desired image, and right click to save.
