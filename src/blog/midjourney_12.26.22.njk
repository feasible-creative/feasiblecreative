  <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Midjourney</strong></a> v4 has been a seriously impressive upgrade from previous versions of the trending AI Art Generator. 

  One incredible enhancement has been the improved ability to use reference images to influence design outputs from Midjourney. As the thumbnail of this article depicts, you can input a real photograph of a human then combine various keywords to generate a piece of AI Art.</p>
  
  <p>In this article, you will learn just how <i>EASY</i> this process is!</p>

<p><strong>(If you are brand new to Midjourney, click below to watch our beginner's tutorial:)</strong></p>

<h2>Reference Images</h2>
<p>
In order to use reference images with Midjourney, you will of course need to select specific images to use. You can either upload image files directly or use image URLs from an internet search engine (<strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure that the url ends in an image file extension, such as <i>.jpg</i> or <i>.png</i>). 


</p>

<img src="/img/AI Art_Reference_2.jpg" class="article-body-img" />

<p>
For this example, we simply used the above as our reference image. Keep in mind, you will generally experience better results by including numerous, high quality photos of the same subject. (Yes, you can use more than one reference image with Midjourney!) 
</p>

<p>
If you are uploading image files, you can click on the plus sign in the bottom left-hand corner of the Discord chat. Then you can simply click "Upload a File" and select your image files. Afterwards, click 'enter' so the images appear as messages within the Discord chat.

<h2>Crafting The Prompt</h2>

<p>
 Next we can build out the Midjourney prompt to create your AI Art design. Firstly, type '/Imagine' within the Discord chat, then hit 'tab' or 'enter'. Once completed, right click on any of your reference images and select 'Copy image link' or 'Copy image address'.
</p>

<img src="/img/AI Art_Reference_1.jpg" class="article-body-img" />
<p> Click within the /Imagine prompt you are building, and paste the first image url. As mentioned, you can include multiple reference photo urls but of course can only copy and paste them one at a time. You will need to include a space in between each url as well.
</p>

<p> The rest of the prompt is up to you, but you can include keywords such as "comic book style" or "photography lighting". In our example, our prompt simply included "old man" and "pixar".
</p>

<h2>Review</h2>
<p>
 While this method is not 100% bulletproof, it is surely improving with each updated version of Midjourney. This is truly an exciting time to be a fan of technology and digital art!

<p>As an added bonus, here is what Midjourney generated from a photo of myself...</p>
