<h2> Midjourney Explained </h2>
<p><a href="https://www.midjourney.com/"><strong>Midjourney</strong></a> is a San Francisco-based research lab that has developed an AI Art Generator currently operating through a Discord server. Users can create mind-blowing AI art images in seconds by typing text-based commands into the chat which instruct the artificial intelligence engine to output designs. At first glance, the idea of developing these designs can be overwhelming. For this reason, in this article we will cover <i>4 Essential Parameters</i> you can use to start creating incredible AI Art with Midjourney!</p>

<h2>1. --ar (Aspect Ratio)</h2>
<p>This first parameter allows users to manipulate the aspect ratio of images generated by Midjourney. The default aspect ratio is 1:1 (1 by 1) which is essentially a standard square shape.</p>

  <p>Midjourney supports many other aspect ratios including 16:9, which is the standard widescreen dimension. In order to add this parameter to your Midjourney parameter, you must type in "--ar [insert aspect ratio]" For example, "--ar 3:2" (without quotation marks) will result in images generated in the 3:2 aspect ratio. The image below shows a "futuristic Mona Lisa" in the 3:2 aspect ratio:

<h2>2. 4K, 8K, Intricate Details, Ultra Realistic (Resolution Keywords)</h2>

<p>Resolution key words including "4K" or "Ultra Realistic" can be added to your Midjourney commands to adjust the detail level of your images. You likely noticed the Mona Lisa design above lacks realistic details which is a result of not including any resolution keywords.


<p>The following image was made including the "8K" keyword:

<p>Clearly, this image is much more detailed vs. the default images the Midjourney engine outputs.
</p>




<h2>3. --chaos (Level of abstraction)</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, the "chaos" parameter can be added to your Midjourney commands to adjust the level of Abstraction. By typing in "Chaos [Level of Abstraction from 0 -- 100]" you can access the chaos parameters. The following images do a great job of comparing the difference between the minimum and maximum levels of chaos (0, 100 respectively): </p>

<h2>4. --no (Remove/Withhold specific keyword)</h2>
<p>Let's say you want to create soup without broth, or a zoo without animals - in these instances, using the "no" parameter is critical. The syntax is "--no [whatever subject you would like to be withheld] (ex: "A futuristic zoo with --no animals")</p>
<p>In the below image, the prompt included "--no seats" which resulting in a person boarding a train without any seats available.</p>
